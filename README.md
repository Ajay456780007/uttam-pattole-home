# 1. PROJECT TITLE
     Fused multimodal-ensembled multilevel attention based Deep learning model for climate risk prediction and warning system

# 2. HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
    OS-Windows 11
    RAM-16GB
    ROM-More than 100 GB
    CPU-1.7 Ghz

# 3. SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
    Software name: Python : Version: 3.9.13 (Download link:
    https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
    Software name: pycharm : Version: 2025.2.3 (Download link: Pycharm 2025.2.3-Community
    Edition (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows)

# 4. HOW TO RUN
    Step 1: Loading the project in PYCHARM
    1. Open pycharm
    2. Go to File, select Open browse the project from your drive and select it. So that the
    project will get loaded into the Pycharm.
    3. For the first time, Pycharm will take some time to load the settings.
    4. Please wait if any process is loading at the bottom of the screen.
    5. Check the Project Interpreter (File -&gt; Settings -&gt; Project Interpreter).
    If this location “(C:\Users\---\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\python.exe) is
    not presented, then add this ‘python.exe’ from the installed location.

    Step 2: Generate the graphs plotted in the paper
    1. current project window in pycharm, Open ‘main.py’, and click
    run button.
    2. When you execute this it will ask you to select anyone from two options like Yes (“Full
    analysis +Plots”) and NO (“Plots from pre evaluated data”).
    3. · If you select the first option, it will execute the complete analysis again and
    display the results. It may take time depending on the analysis.
    4. · Second option will display the results from the stored data i.e, mainly to skip the
    execution time.

    [Execution time expected: “Full analysis +Plots” — 10 hr]
    [Execution time expected: “Plots from pre evaluated data” – 30 sec]
